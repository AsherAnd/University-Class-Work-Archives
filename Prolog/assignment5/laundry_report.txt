For the laundry.pl file, the first step was to make the actions for the robot, such as fetch, putAway, and
other precondition axioms. To implement these, we had to go through the steps on how each action would be 
possible. For the successor state axioms, we needed to implement what made it true and also what would negate
the precondition axioms; for example, we needed to create the wet predicate by making sure the clothes were 
washed but not yet dried to make sure they were wet. The heuristic predicates called useless were to avoid 
redundancies and to create a smoother process. For example, don't add soap when you already have soap in the 
washer. 

The implementation was simple to write, but finding the relevant information to add to each predicate took 
some thinking. We ran the tests on an MSI PS63 Modern 8SC with an intel core i7 8th gen CPU with 16 gigabytes
of RAM.



%%%%% INTERACTION IN REGULAR MODE
%%%%% Include your interaction below when testing the planner in regular mode (ie. without declarative heuristics)

?- solve_problem(regular, 1, 6, P).
P = [washClothes(cl1, w1), putAway(cl1, w1), addSoftener(cl1, w1), addSoap(cl1, w1), fetch(cl1, h1)]
Yes (9.28s cpu, solution 1, maybe more)

?- solve_problem(regular, 2, 6, P).
P = [dryClothes(cl1, C), washClothes(cl1, C), putAway(cl1, C), addSoftener(cl1, C), addSoap(cl1, C), fetch(cl1, h1)]
Yes (420.91s cpu, solution 1, maybe more)



%%%%% INTERACTION IN HEURISTIC MODE
%%%%% Include your interaction below when testing the planner in heuristic mode (ie. when using declarative heuristics for pruning)

Although we did not have enough time to run the heuristic code, we wrote some implementations 
for it.
